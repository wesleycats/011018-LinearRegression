# MachineLearning
This project is my first attempt to create a program using machine learning.

## Features
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/wesleycats/MachineLearning/blob/Develop/Linear%20Regression/script.js)

## Software Anaylse 
Because machine learning is not so easy, I would like to work with it in a known enviorment that supports it.

update 03-10-18: 
I know that Python is the go-to machine learning languagel, because of the libraries like: Tensorflor, Numpy, Keras, etc. But because I only have 2 weeks and are new to machine learning, I won't make it harder as possible for me.

update 04-10-18:
I just found out that Unity even offers a Machine Learning Agents Toolkit. Additionally I know I could use C# library Math.NET Numerics to make a neural network with the help of matrices. Because of these reasons, Unity has a big chance to be the enviorment I will work with.

update 05-10-18:
Since today I know that I can use Javascript aswell. This way I can keep it as simple and clear as possible for myself. So I choose to begin in Javascript and if I have finished this, I could try and make a game with it in Unity. I want to do this in Unity, because I already have a small setup where I can easily implement the machine learning aspect.

## Learn goals 
- I want to learn how machine learning works on a small scale
- I want to learn how machine learning works with linear regression
- I want to learn more about matrices
- I want to learn more about how we as humans learns

## Planning 
Weekend before week 1: Doing research (What is machine learning and what can it be used for?)

Week 1:
Monday - Research (What is machine learning and what can it be used for?)
Tuesday - Research (What is machine learning and what can it be used for?)
Wednesday - Research (In which languages can you use machine learning?)
Thursday - Research (In which languages can you use machine learning?)
Friday - Research / Writing the whole program in Javascript, HTML and CSS (Because of all the research, I can easily write the whole program in a day)
Saturday - x
Sunday - x

Week 2:
Monday - Polish the program (make it user-friendly)
Tuesday - Put the program on portfolio
Wednesday - Hand in code
Thursday - Make reflection
Friday - Hand in reflection
